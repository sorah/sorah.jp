## Workflow

### Don't turn social feeds off

Some people turn off social feeds (twitter, facebook, etc.) for productivity, but I don't.
It doesn't make effect for productivity (at least for me).

### Feeds

I use Feedly to subscribe feeds.

I read only few blogs and news feeds related to IDOLM@STER.
However I subscribe many blogs, but I read them only when I'm not busy.
